# Mobile_inverted_pendulum

This project discuss the implementation of various control Algorithms of controlling mobile inverted pendulum.,<br/>
Along with the designing of control Algorithms , I have also discussed some core concepts related to Modern Control theory at my website.

Thanks to Professor Steve Brunton for providing crash course on youtube on Control Algorithms and providing initial Matlab Scripts for these course.

Controll Algorithm Implemented:
 
1. PID
2. LQR
3. LQG

Included Folders<br/>
1.natural_response_of_system_with_control_design 
(scripts for evaluating natural response of system (check eigen values of system))
 
2.Linear_quadratic_control
scripts for lqr controller
